    "bio": "Colin grew up in rural Northern Virgina, with a childhood full of all the sports and instruments a child can handle. In 2011, Colin moved to Montana to attend the College of Business and run track at MSU. He soon found his love for craft beer and his sister's gift of a home brewing kit kicked off his interest in developing recipes and testing new brews on friends. Colin is thrilled to join Bozeman's prestigious brewing community and open the doors of LBP Brewing. While you'll find him around the brewery most days, he also enjoys working around the farm, hiking with his wife and dogs, skiing or hunting.",
